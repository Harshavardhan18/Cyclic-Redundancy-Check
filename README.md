# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check
This CRC code is used for detecting error in the recieved message/data.

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. 
CRCs are so called because the check (data verification) value is a redundancy (it expands the message without adding information) and the algorithm is based on cyclic codes.

Advantages:
Simple to implement in binary hardware. 
Easy to analyze mathematically.
Good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels.
